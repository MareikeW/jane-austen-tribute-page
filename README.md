FreeCodeCamp.org - Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page

In this project I built a tribute page for the English author Jane Austen.
To successfully pass this project on freecodecamp.org, one has to fulfill certain requirements e.g. 
working with ids, image, and external links.

For building the page I used HTML and CSS.
